## Name Lookup
   - Name Hiding ( the same meaning as "Name Shadowing" or "Name Masking" )

### Scope Resolution Operator
- With the use of unary scope resolution operator, it is possible to reach the global namespace area and get rid of name shadowing.
- unary operator : it has got only one operand
- binary operator: it has got two operands
- scope resolution operator (::) can be unary or binary operator

-**Example**: Name Lookup and Name Shadowing 
   - Name-lookup will be done for the x value in the right hand side. However, this value is not the value of x in the global namespace.
   - That's why, local x definition (left hand side x) is initialized with a garbage value.
   - Using x with garbage value leads to undefined behaviour. 

#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <stdio.h>

int x = 45;

int main(){
	int x = x; // undefined behaviour 
	// Warning C6001: Using uninitialized memory 'x'
	// Error C4700 : uninitialized local variable 'x' used	
}
